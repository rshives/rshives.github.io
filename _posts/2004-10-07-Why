I've been brushing up on my programming skills the last few days.  Researching RSS and learning more about XML.  I've also started learning about Python.  I learned about Perl a few years ago and enjoyed writing Perl code.  I've been in the programming world for quite a while.  Started back in the 70s when the math and "business" departments in my high school got computers.  The math department got a Commodore 64 and the "business" department got a TRS-80.  I learned a few bits of BASIC, enough to print out denigrating remarks about my classmates...  The first time I "officially" learned programming was at a Tech school in Kansas.  I learned BASIC, RPG-3, and CoBOL on an IBM System 36.  I also taught myself the C language using an Aztec C compiler on an Amiga.  After that I took a break from it during the 10 years I was in the Army.  Now I've recently gotten "officially" taught computer science again, earning my BS in Computer Science.

<br />I've also been listening to a lot of podcasts and am finally caught up with them all, I think.  Got turned on to a lot of new websites and blogs listening to the podcasts too.
