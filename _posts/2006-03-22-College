I'm half way through my second class.  The first one was a nightmare.  Not the classwork, I breezed through that, but the administration.  I signed up with them with the express understanding that my company was going to be paying for the class.  I was told that all my charged would be defered for 30 days past the last day of class, allowing me to have time to turn in all statements to my company for payment.  If it's one thing I'll learn going through this MBA course it to read the fine print and never believe anything the salesperson says...  <br /><br />Only the first and last day of class are held in a classroom setting.  The other "classes" are online.  The class week runs from Thursday to Wednesday, but the first day you attend the classroom class is Wednesday, the last day of the class week.  So I attend the classroom class, posted as I was supposed to Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Monday I went to work and found out I was being laid off.  I wanted to drop the class because I wouldn't be able to pay for it, but was told I couldn't.  You can only drop a class within the first two weeks...  To me I hadn't attended class for two weeks, not even one week, but technically the way the run the class I had...  Luckily I got an extension at work and have more time to find another job, but I was close to calling the whole thing off.
