I have a problem finishing projects.  I'm great at starting projects and working on them for a while, but then I get started on something else and put the current project aside.  I'm going back to one of the projects I started a while back, an application that interfaces with Backpack.  Backpack is a web application from 37 Signals for lists.  Lists like todo lists, shopping lists, whatever.  This application will sit on the desktop and show the list items from my Backpack account.  I'll hopefully convert it to a sidebar application when I figure out how to do that.
