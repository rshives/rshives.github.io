So, as I was working on the Backpack application I started another project.  What did I tell you?  Anyway, the new project is along the same lines so I don't feel too bad about it.  And to make it even better, I actually finished it.  It's a Backpack API viewer.  It shows you names and ids of pages, lists, and notes.  It will make it easier to finish the other project because I'll be able to find out ids for the items I need.
