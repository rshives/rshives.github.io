I heard my first political radio spot today.  It was for a local Senatorial race but still.  Colorado passed a ban on smoking this week.  It wasn't even put to a vote by the citizens.  It was all done quietly by the politians.  More of our freedom taken away by the few whiners instead of the majority.  It's going to be a long election cycle.
