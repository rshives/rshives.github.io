Added some Highrise stuff. Still haven't figured out the Login problem. Going to do some research and study up on website security so I can understand it. Weekend went okay. I went to the ER on Friday I think. Heart was going weird, but hasn't since so don't know what that was all about. So I'm using Highrise and Backpack. Both are web applications from 37Signals. 37signals.com is thier website and they have really good applications. Highrise is a contact management system and Backpack is a project management system. I'm still figuring out how to use both apps in conjunction but I think they will work together pretty nicely.
