My surgery date is October 24th.  I know in my previous posts I seemed pretty excited about having this surgery, but since then I've been waffling quite a bit about it.  I've actually started changing my eating habits and exercising, and I've actually lost a few pounds.  So that got me thinking about whether I really need this or not.  Right now I'm still planning on going through with it, but we'll see.<br />I have my personal website up where I show off my l33t coding skills...  It's  <br /><a href="http://www.candrsolutions.net">C &amp; R Solutions</a>  I designed and built the website and all the applications.  My wife is going to help me with the graphics and stuff so it'll be changing every so often.
