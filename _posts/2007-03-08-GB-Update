So, it's been about 5 months since my surgery.  I usually weigh in on Saturdays and last Saturday I was down to 262.  From 351 on the day of surgery.  I feel great.  I'm over the fried food cravings and usually eat healthy foods.  I am back in the gym trying to gain my strength back and I'm actually back to playing raquetball. <br />The first day I got back on the court I was laying on the floor more than I was standing.  My sense of balance was way off and my foot speed was so slow it wasn't funny.  But I get better every time I play. <br />I'm not in any kind of pain from the surgery although I have this nasty torn muscle in my right lat.  It doesn't hurt unless I'm in a specific position, and then it feels like someone is sticking a knife in my side and twisting it.  It's strange because I can poke and push around without any pain, but if I move my arm a certain way it hurts like crazy.<br />I'm back taking classes at UOP.  Class starts on March 15th and I already have a &gt;700 word paper due.  This should be interesting.<br />All in all I'm doing great, much better than I thought I would.
