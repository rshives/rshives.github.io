So there's been a lot going on in my life. Nothing blog-worthy though. My wife is going through an MS flare-up so I've been dealing with that a lot. I've been doing a lot of work for my MBA classes as well. And I've actually been doing some actual work. Getting more into C# development for the current project I'm working on. I got a new laptop for an early Christmas present. It's an HP, nothing real fancy but I just wanted one so that I could write code and have something that's "mine". That may sound selfish, but sometimes you just need something that's "yours". This laptop has Vista Home Premium on it and it's taking a little getting used to. It's crashed on me a few times, but so far I'm liking it. I'm getting it set up the way I like it and will be working on my website soon.
