### {{ page.title }}
My wife has kept a diary on Open Diary (<a href="http://www.opendiary.com/">http://www.opendiary.com</a>) for a very long time.  I think I even have one on there.  I've started several journals, made a few posts then lost interest.  I heard a lot of talk about blogs, and figured they were just new forms of diaries.  Which I suppose they can be that but many are being used for a lot more.  They are used to express one's opinion, share one's knowledge, and organize events.  But what made me decide to start one is podcasting. 
<br />
<br />According to Dan Gillmor podcasting is delivering audio to MP3 players like the iPod (<a href="http://www.ipodder.org/">http://www.ipodder.org</a>).  It uses RSS, which is a format for syndicating news and the content of news-like sites, including major news sites like Wired, news-oriented community sites like Slashdot, and personal weblogs (<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html">http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html</a>).
<br />
<br />Podcasting is very new.  Like a month new, if that, and I have a feeling it is going to take off. Some of you may see a small orange rectangle with XML text <img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~rlshives/xml.gif" />.  That is the link to the RSS feed.  You'll have to install an aggrigator to pull the audio.  I use iPodder (<a href="http://www.ipodder.org/">http://www.ipodder.org</a>), which uses iTunes to store the podcasts and then I can transfer them to my iPod and listen to them whenever I choose.
<br />
<br />Right now I'm subscribed to Adam Curry's, Evil Genius', DotNetRocks', three from itconversations, and Scripting Secrets' podcasts.  Very cool stuff and a very cool, new emerging technology.
