title: On the Upcoming Presidential Debates
---

### {{ page.title }}
I think President Bush will win all three upcoming debates.  My opinion is based on his previous performances as well as his vision for the future of America.  In the debates of 2000 President Bush soundly defeated Al Gore, not only in my opinion, but in the opinion of the informed, intelligent citizens of the nation.  President Bush has an optimistic view of America's future.  He is a leader.  Good leaders do not provide the followers' every need.  They provide a solid foundation in order for the followers to succeed on their own. The rules of the debates were set during negotiations and both the campaigns agreed to them. Senator Kerry's campaign is already trying to break the rules.  The rules say that the signaling lights that warn the candidate his time has run out are to be mounted on the podium.  Senator Kerry's campaign agreed to this rule, but today they want them mounted somewhere else.  They don't like the fact that the audience can see the lights when they come on.
Some in the media are saying that the Presidential election will be won in the first thirty minutes of tonight's debate.  In that time I expect Senator Kerry to change his position at least four times.
