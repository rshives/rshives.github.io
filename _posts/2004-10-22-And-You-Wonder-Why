And you wonder why prescription drugs are so expensive?  
<br />
<br />During lunch with my wonderful and beautiful wife, a commercial came on the radio:  Attention former Vioxx users due to Merck's recall you may be entitled to money...  Contact us and get in on our lawsuit against Merck.  Not those exact words of course, but that's the gist.  And it was from some law firm in Georgia I think.  My wife said she heard a local law firm offering the same chance.
<br />
<br />The same people who will get in on this lawsuit will be the ones complaining about the high cost of prescription drugs.  Even if Merck wins the lawsuit, they will have to pay for the cost of defending themselves.  And guess what, Merck customers will be the ones paying that cost.
<br />
<br />So thank you trial lawyers for raising the cost of prescription drugs again.
