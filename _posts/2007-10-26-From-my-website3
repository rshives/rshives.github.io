As you can see I have re-vamped the whole site. I've built this website using Visual Studio Codename Orcas, with a SQL Server backend database. I've implemented site user account functionality, but you can get to any page except the database maintainance pages. Pretty soon I'll be locking down some of the pages and you'll need a user account to see them. It won't cost anything for an account and I'm only doing it so that I can learn how to administer user accounts. So help me out and sign up for a new account.
