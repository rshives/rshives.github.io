### {{ page.title }}
(8/22/07) I've been fairly busy this last month. Been applying for different jobs, working on new areas of the website, a few events for the Riders, and gearing up for football! Speaking of, I've finished the NFL schedule. You should be able to see all the games for the 2007 season as well as all the games for your favorite team. I've done a lot of work on the Productivity Suite, which you can't see unless you ask me for access. I'm still thinking about how to format the entries on the front page. Not sure how to go about it since it's a straight pull from the database. I'm also thinking about how to incorporate media, such as pictures, audio, and video. That's all for now.
