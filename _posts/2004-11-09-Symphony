My wife won tickets to the symphony from a local radio station, <a href="http://www.peak951.com/">Peak 95.1</a> for Saturday night and we had a great time. Friends from Denver came down and went with us. The <a href="http://www.csphilharmonic.org/">Colorado Springs Philharmonic</a> played at the <a href="http://www.pikespeakcenter.org/">Pike's Peak Center</a> and had a special guest. Ani Aznavoorian played an orchestra written specifically for her by Laderman. She also played Rococo Variations by Tchaikovsky.
<br />Ani is a world class cellist and was amazing. She's been playing since she was three years old and has played all over the world. We had gone a couple of weeks before, again with tickets won by my wife, and heard the orchestra play Beethoven.
<br />I liked listening to Tchaikovsky much better than Beethoven. It seemed to be more rhythmic. Beethoven seemed more hard to follow because it changes directions often.
<br />It was amazing to hear Ani play the cello. I really enjoyed it.
