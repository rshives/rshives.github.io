Over the next few days I'll be posting some of the applications I have developed.  None of them are ready to be published, and most of them were created out of the neccessity to learn about a particular programming technique.  The first one is called CRStore.  I was developing this one for my wife.  She wanted an application to store her different website usernames and passwords.  Here are some screenshots of it.<br /><br />Main Screen<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6219/584/1600/CRStoreMain.1.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6219/584/320/CRStoreMain.1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Edit an Item<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6219/584/1600/CRStoreEdit.1.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6219/584/320/CRStoreEdit.1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Add a New Item<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6219/584/1600/CRStoreNew.2.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6219/584/320/CRStoreNew.2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />About<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6219/584/1600/CRStoreAbout.1.jpg"><img style="cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6219/584/320/CRStoreAbout.1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />What I was trying to do is use an XML file to store the website, username and password data.  I used an XML parser to parse the XML file and display the data in a tree object.  I was also trying to find a way to encrypt the data in the file.  This proved daunting and I'm still trying to figure out how to do it.<br /><br />Now all I need to do is find some place online to store the files so anyone can look at them.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.candrsolutions.net/MyDevelopment/CRStore/CRStore.zip">CRStore.zip</a>
