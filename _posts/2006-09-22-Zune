I've been following the launch of Microsoft's new DAP called Zune.  It seems like a very cool device.  It'll play most of the popular audio formats.  It'll also play movies and show pictures.  And the coolest part of it is that you can send songs back and forth between your friends wirelessly.<br />I've had my iPod for quite a while, but it's pretty annoying to use.  I thought it would be a cool device, but it's hard for me to slide my finger just right to get the track I want.  I always seem to go right past it.<br />The Zune will be a cool device to watch for this holiday season.<br /><a href="http://www.zunerama.com/">Zunerama</a> a cool blog about it.
