### {{ page.title }}
I am nearing the end of my current employment.  The project I am working on is nearing the sustainment stage so the company is de-staffing people.  There was a big round of de-staffing in February and I was on the chopping block.  I was lucky enough to catch a break because a couple of people on my team that were not on the chopping block moved to different projects.  So was able to fill one of their slots.<br /><br />I have until the end of May to find another position within the company, otherwise I'll be transitioning to the unemployment lines by the end of June.<br /><br />I'm kind of want to move into a different line of work.  I sitll want to develop software, but if I could develop accounting software or business management software that would be great.
