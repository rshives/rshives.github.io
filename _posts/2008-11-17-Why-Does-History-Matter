<p class="MsoNormal">History is inescapable. History is repeatable. Those who do not have some sense of it are doomed to repeat it.<span>  </span>No matter what subject you are studying, if you can study its history you can predict its future.<span>  </span>Why did Barack Obama win the Presidency of the United States? Why is Europe’s economy headed towards recession? Why have the Detroit Lions not won a game all year, while the Tennessee Titans have won them all?<span>  </span>The history of these subjects could reveal the answers to these questions and may predict the consequences.<span>  </span>In the past, professional coaches who do not win games are relieved of their positions and are free to pursue other interests.<span>  </span>Economies that enter recession either collapse and fail or recover and provide prosperity. Nations that are ruled by socialists inevitably fail. History can show us how these events transpire and can help us either prevent or allow the outcomes.</p>
