So I went to my follow up appointment on Tuesday.  I have everything I needed to do, done.  It looks like my surgery will be mid - end September.  Now I have to go back over all the information I received and make sure I remember what I can eat.  Need to start buying and taste testing stuff, get in the habit of taking vitamans, and learning how to drink in sips.
